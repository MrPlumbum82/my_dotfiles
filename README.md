### TODO
  - I don't understand some of the UI Sidebar issues with different file types, related to git signify maybe?... guess only shows when there is a change in the file meh...
  - Update the colors to what you like, espessicaly for git signify (hunks) (green and red... or something)
  - I can't get the tabline to work!!! what the hell man!
  - Get linting to work for TS, TSX, JSX, JS, etc... COC baby!
  - keep updating your config and organize your dotfiles better... also make notes of how to redo this config again on a new system...
    - install powerline fonts...
    - need some python packages... ripgrep... others...
  - Write a complete list of all your keybindings...
  - Also make a list of vim (nvim) default bindings you are learning or getting used to... like 'i' and 'a'... just make a list of everything
